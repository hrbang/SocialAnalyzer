# Contributing
We love your input! Make sure you read these guidelines before you start participating.

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your Pull Requests:

1. Fork the repo from main branch
2. If you've added or changes code, please add [test-code] as prefix to the Pull Request title
3. If you've added or changed documentations, please add [test-text] as prefix to the Pull Request title
4. If you've added or changed something else, please add [test-other] as prefix to the Pull Request title
5. Add description and references if possible
6. Issue that Pull Request!

These tags [test-code], [test-text] or [test-other] will trigger a Dedicated Testing System called Macaw. Macaw will issue a UUID4 for tracking some tests. If Macaw approves the changes, then your Pull Request will be merged and the changes will be added to a queue. The system may revert or remove changes after merging them due to test failure

Example of title: [test-text] added documentation to functions

## Write bug reports with short title, descriptive summary, and example
1. Add short title but not a long one
2. Add descriptive summary of the issue
3. Add example of how to reproduce the issue

You can also add notes, screenshots or anything related to the issue that might be helpful

## Coding style
Macaw will take care of it, but remember to write a "readable" code as much as possible
